## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [React](https://react.dev/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Backend:** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) with [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/) and [Pydantic v2](https://docs.pydantic.dev/)
- **Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **Business Intelligence:** [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) (embedded via [`@superset-ui/embedded-sdk`](https://github.com/apache/superset-ui/tree/master/packages/superset-ui-embedded-sdk))

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:** SPA built with React, styled using Tailwind, communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
- **Backend:** FastAPI serves APIs, manages authentication, business logic, and database interactions using SQLModel and Pydantic v2.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL stores all persistent data.
- **BI Layer:** Apache Superset runs as a separate service; interactive dashboards are embedded in the dashboard using the JS SDK.

A typical request flow:
1. User interacts with the React frontend.
2. Frontend fetches and submits data via FastAPI endpoints.
3. FastAPI processes requests, interacts with PostgreSQL, and responds.
4. Embedded Superset dashboards visualize analytics directly within the frontend.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/college-branch-dashboard.git
cd college-branch-dashboard
```

### 2. Environment Variables

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both frontend and backend folders.
- Fill in required variables (API URLs, DB credentials, Superset configs, etc.).

### 3. Install Dependencies

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Apache Superset

- Follow [Superset’s official documentation](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset/) for installation.
- Ensure it is running and accessible to the frontend for embedding.

### 4. Database Setup

- Create a PostgreSQL database and user.
- Apply initial migrations (if any) using Alembic or FastAPI scripts.

## 📊 Embedding Superset Dashboards

- The dashboard embeds Superset BI charts using [`@superset-ui/embedded-sdk`](https://github.com/apache/superset-ui/tree/master/packages/superset-ui-embedded-sdk).
- **Configuration:**  
  - Set Superset host URL and authentication method in your frontend `.env`.
  - Use the provided SDK hooks/components to render dashboards in React.
- **Example Usage:**

  ```jsx
  import { DashboardEmbed } from '@superset-ui/embedded-sdk';

  <DashboardEmbed
    id="your-dashboard-uuid"
    supersetDomain={process.env.SUPERSET_URL}
    {...otherProps}
  />
  ```

- Refer to the [Superset Embedded SDK docs](https://superset-ui.dev/embedded-sdk/) for more customization.
